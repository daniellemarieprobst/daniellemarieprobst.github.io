	<h1 class="h1">“you felt like you were taking home your very own work of art”</h1>
	<p class="p1">Indeed, artwork can be as much a part of the identity of a record as the sound. Billions of music fans over the past century have taken pleasure from looking again and again at old album covers. The name “album” comes from a pre-war era when it literally referred to the album that contained the 78rpm shellac disc, held in a drab heavy paper sleeve with only a title embossed on the front and spine. Sometimes the discs were contained in a leather book, similar to a photographic album. The first signs of change came in the 30s, from pioneering designers such as Alex Steinweiss, whose illustrated covers – for singers such as Paul Robeson, or the classical records of Beethoven – led to huge increases in sales.

	The following collections is a collection of album covers from the 60's to present day based on the music in my music library. Many of these covers like "Sticky Fingers" by The Rolling Stones and "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts CLub Band" by The Beatles are considered some of the most famous and ground-breaking albums of all time.   </p>
