      For Charlotte receiving art therapy taught her more about art than any lesson or teacher. “Art is fluid and creates energy which can be felt, art is not only visual”. Elitism and ego are negativities Charlotte avoids in the art world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte is an active campaigner and activist for many issues, such as mental health awareness, women’s rights, anti-capitalism, and anti-war and for breaking down rape stigma and fighting against rape culture. With her own mental illness Charlotte wants to prove that a person such as herself does not have to be deemed unemployable or incompetent as she works against the odds every day, speaking out about her struggles to break down stigma and show that mental illness is like any other physical illness.

      In this ongoing collection her work focuses on her internal struggles with, and the worlds discrimination against – mental illness.

    <p>
      In the past the melancholic was viewed as a romantic outsider, creating poetry and music laden with sorrow, misery and pathos. There is a long tradition of art as foundational to culture and artistic practices tend to be ritualised, curated and held in high esteem so could be potentially therapeutic both for individuals and collectively for example via art workshops and exhibition of artwork created by those with mental illness.
