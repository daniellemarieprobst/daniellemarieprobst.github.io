      The art created by outsiders reveals illuminating truths about what it is to be human. The work is real and pure – and has a depth that contrasts with the often contrived offerings of conventionally trained artists. It shows us what we dare not think, let alone speak. The artists tell seemingly bizarre stories, translate hallucinatory experiences, or depict imaginary and fantastical worlds which trace painful personal trajectories. They reveal the psyche; our dreams, our nightmares, the afterlife. The art is unknowing yet visionary. The artists do not subscribe to standard art-school criteria – and this is what separates them from the mainstream.

      From a psychoanalytic perspective, outsider art delves into our vast unconscious, that part which represents us but which we barely recognise or are aware of. We look, in order to understand the other and to understand ourselves. Outsider art adds gravitas to an existence that nowadays can feel very superficial. It is uncensored. It transcends speech.

      Outsider artists report being compelled to create work, drawing and painting obsessively for hours and days at a time. This is fascinating, especially if the same individuals experience severe difficulties in day-to-day living as is often the case with serious mental illness.

      Our interest in the art of the mentally ill may follow from a morbid fascination with the diseased, the odd, the eccentric. In Victorian times the public would visit asylums as a pastime to view “the lunatics”. Care in the community policies means that the “mad” now live among us but not alongside us. The muttering old woman in the cafe, the dazed and staring sunken eyes of the unknown figure lying on cardboard on a busy London thoroughfare, the woman with knotted hair, swearing at full volume on an underground platform as the train pulls in.

      In the past the melancholic was viewed as a romantic outsider, creating poetry and music laden with sorrow, misery and pathos. There is a long tradition of art as foundational to culture and artistic practices tend to be ritualised, curated and held in high esteem so could be potentially therapeutic both for individuals and collectively for example via art workshops and exhibition of artwork created by those with mental illness.
