<p class="twelve"> The Cold War was a state of geopolitical tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in <br> the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO <br> allies and others).
<br>
<br>
The <a href="start.html">Olympics</a> came at a difficult time for Sovietâ€“U.S. relations, as they were deep in the Cold War. Only months before the games began, the USSR had invaded Afghanistan, and there was speculation that <br> the Soviet Union might not be allowed to compete <br> in these Olympics. 
<br>
<br>
The Soviet Union did compete in the Lake Placid games, but the United States and 65 other nations boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow <br> later that year. </p>
